Practice Questions

1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Ans-	* True
	* False
	These are written with an initial uppercase letter 'True' (1) and False(0).

2. What are the three Boolean operators?

Ans-	AND,OR,NOT

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

Ans-	AND OPERATOR 
	True AND False - False
	True AND True - True
	False AND False - False
	False AND True - False

	OR OPERATOR 
	True OR False - True
	True OR True - True
	False OR False - False
	False OR True - True

	NOT OPERATOR
	NOT True - False
	Not False - True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans-	False
	False
	True	
	False	
	False
	True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

Ans-	* less than ( < )
	* less than or equal to ( <= )
	* greater than ( > )
	* greater than or equal to ( >= )
	* equal to ( == )
	* not equal to ( != )


6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

Ans- 	* The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as each other.
	* The = operator (assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable on the left.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

Ans-	A condition refers to a Boolean expression or statement that evaluates to True or False. 
	A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its condition is True or False, and almost every flow control statement uses a condition.


8. Identify the three blocks in this code:\
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans-	Outer Block
	spam=0

	First Conditional Block
	if spam == 10:
		print('eggs') will be executed

	Nested Conditional Block (if-else statement inside the first block):
	if spam > 5:
		print('bacon') will be executed
	else:
		print('ham') will be executed

	else conditional block
		print('spam') will be executed


9.Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

Ans- 	spam=int(input())
	if spam==10:
    		print('Hello')
    	elif spam==2:
		print('Howdy')
        else:
		print('spam')


10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

Ans- 	CTRL + C 

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

Ans-	break
	When the program execution reaches a break statement, the program execution breaks and terminate the entire loop.
	continue
	When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loopâ€™s condition.


12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

Ans-	range(10)
	Executes from 0 to 9
	
	range(0,10)
	Executes from 0 to 9

	range(0,10,1)
	Executed from 0 to 9 with increment 1

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Ans-	
for i in range(1,10+1):
    print(i)

i=1
while i<=11:
    print(i)
    i+=1
		
14.If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans- 	import spam
	spam.bacon()	
	
abs() will return the absolute value of a number.
Eg: 	print(abs(-10))
	10

round() takes in two numbers, one to be rounded, and one that specifies the number of decimal places to include.
Eg:	print(round(17.24544,4))
	17.25
